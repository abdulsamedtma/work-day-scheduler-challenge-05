# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code
## Description
The Work Day Scheduler is a web-based application built using  HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootsrap, JQuery as well we Day.js. Wrapped all code that interacts with the DOM in a call to jQuery to ensure that the code isn't run until the browser has finished rendering all the elements in the html. This simple calender application allows users to save events for each hour of the day and build to meet user-defined criteria.

## Key Summary features of this project include:
. Current Day and time day is displayed at the top of the calender.
. Use daily planner to create a schedule
. Application displays timeblock for standard business hours of 9am&ndash;5pm
. Click into time block and enter a text event as per your daily schedule.
. Click the save button for that timeblock to save the text for that event in local storage.
. Even when pages is refreshed the save evenets still persist. 
.This should help users with efficiient and effective time management in daily planning. 

**Motivation** 
A Work Day Scheduler is created with the motivation of improving time management, enhancing productivity, and promoting personal organization. It provides a visual representation of the work day, allowing individuals to allocate tasks, prioritize activities, and stay on track with their deadlines. By providing reminders and alerts, it ensures important events are not overlooked. The scheduler helps reduce stress by offering a structured plan, promoting a healthy work-life balance, and enabling efficient task management. Overall, it serves as a valuable tool for individuals to effectively plan, schedule, and manage their work day, leading to increased efficiency and a greater sense of control over their daily activities.

As a coding bootcamp student, the main goal of creating this application would be to gain practical experience and develop important skills in web development. Here are the main goals of creating this application as a coding bootcamp student:

1. Apply Knowledge: By building a Work Day Scheduler, student including my self can apply the programming concepts and skills they have learned during the bootcamp. It allows them to practice and reinforce their understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

2. Hands-on Experience: Creating a real-world application like a Work Day Scheduler provides valuable hands-on experience. It allows the student to work on a complete project, from planning and designing the user interface to implementing the functionality and testing.

3. Project Management: Developing this application as a bootcamp student offers an opportunity to practice project management skills. They can learn to break down the tasks, set milestones, and manage their time effectively to complete the project within a given timeframe.

4. Problem Solving: Building a Work Day Scheduler involves solving various challenges and problems along the way. It helps the student develop problem-solving skills by finding solutions to issues related to data storage, UI interaction, and time management features.

6. Portfolio Building: Creating a Work Day Scheduler serves as a valuable addition to the student's portfolio. It showcases my ability to create functional web applications and demonstrates their skills to potential employers.

7. Learning New Technologies: The project may involve integrating libraries, frameworks, or APIs, allowing the me to explore and learn new technologies beyond the core bootcamp curriculum. This helped widens my skill set and enhances learning experience.

Overall, the main goal of creating a Work Day Scheduler as a coding bootcamp student is to gain practical experience, apply learned concepts, develop essential skills, and build a portfolio that demonstrates my capabilities as a web developer. It serves as a stepping stone towards becoming proficient in web development and prepares my self and other student for future projects and career opportunities.s.

## Usage.
Here's a summary of how to use the Work Day Scheduler in 5 bullet points:

1. Open the Application: Access the Work Day Scheduler through a web server or by directly opening the "index.html" file in a web browser.

2. Interact with Time Blocks: Each time block represents an hour of the work day. Read existing entries in the textareas, input new tasks/events, and save them using the corresponding save buttons.

3. Color Coding: Time blocks are color-coded to indicate past, present, and future hours. The colors help you identify the current hour and differentiate between past and upcoming hours.

4. Review and Modify Entries: Reload or revisit the Work Day Scheduler to review saved entries. Modify existing entries by editing the textareas and save them again to update. Add new entries by typing tasks/events and saving.

5. Stay Organized: Use the Work Day Scheduler to track your tasks, prioritize activities, and have a visual representation of your work day. Save your progress regularly to ensure your entries are stored in the browser's local storage.

Note: The specific functionalities and features of the Work Day Scheduler may vary based on the implementation, but these general steps should help you understand how to use and make the most of the application.

## Credit 
I would like to give credit to my tutor for their valuable guidance and assistance in explaining how the concepts of the Work Day Scheduler application work. Their explanations helped me understand the DOM manipulation, event handling, and local storage usage involved in building the application. Their support was instrumental in my learning process and in successfully implementing the features of the application.
